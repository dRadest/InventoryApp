Functionality
--------------

- OverallActivity

Displays a list of items in a list view. Change to grid view by clicking 'Change view' in the overflow menu.
You can change sort order by clicking 'Sort by' in the overflow menu.
Each item has a sell icon on the right. Clicking on it decreases quantity of the item by one.
Clicking on an item in a list/grid takes you to item's detail activity
By clicking FAB button you can add a new item to the list

- DetailActivity

Displays item's detail information
Clicking on product's name enables you to change/edit name of the product
Clicking on web address will perform a web search for that address
Clicking on email address will open an email app to send an email to that address
Buttons at the end are self-explanatory

At the bottom, taping on a 'take a photo' view opens a camera application to take a photo
